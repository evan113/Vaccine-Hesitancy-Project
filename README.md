# Vaccine-Hesitancy-Project

This project aims to use social identity theory and system justification theory to understand the underlying mechanisms of national identity, 
political ideology, justification of the status quo, and trust in relation to vaccine hesitancy and COVID related conspiracy theories across 
the US, the Philippines, and China.
